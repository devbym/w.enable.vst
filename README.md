<h1>Welcome to the BOWSER.vst plugin Git repository.</h1>
<p>Since this is my first Git, things might get a little messy. Learning as we get on with this project.
Helpful tips about the general use of Github or community culture are appreciated.<p/>

<h2>Let's get it on.</h2>
<p>The BOWSER vst-plugin. "Web-enables your favorite DAW"</p>
<br>
<p>Nowadays there are hundreds of emulated synthesizers and drumcomputers available on the world wide web. Some better than others, and a small number of those are top-of-the-bill in terms such as user-friendliness, sound-quality, functionality or general use. While using these web-synths i have tot switch between my browser and DAW. If i make a drumrythem on html5drummachine.com i need to WV export the rythem and possibly even a score sheet to be able to use this ryhtem in my DAW
<br>
This creates several problems in the process of making (digital) music on a computer or digital device. 
<ul>
<li>No interaction between synth in browser and current song/loop in your DAW</li>
<li>No tempo or beat sync, its mere impossible to start both applications at the exact same moment </li>
  <li>No CC mapping or score recording</li>
  <li>Effects, modulation or ocscillation can't be assigned</li></ul></p>
  <br>
  <p> While some functione mentioned above can technically be assigned to a MIDI-supporting web-app from within your DAW, not too many people have the know-how or even the patience to set these things up. And you will always be confronted with uncontrollable latency, due to the webtraffic being sent and recieved. This doenst happen in real-time, but the speed by which internet traffic goes in and out is never completely stable and thus even a proper Midiassign through use of your webbrowser isn't very useable for live music creation in any studio setup.</p>
 <P> This BOWSER.vst project is meant to solve these problems and make web-synths playable, recordable and editable as if it were a native generator plugin.
 BOWSER will be an application built on the VST-framework by Steinberg.
  Their VST plugin framework is the most commonly used software framework in audio procesing, pretty much all popular DAW's support VST (3) or are able to embed it by use of a wrapper or convertor. </p> <a href="steinberg.com/vst">More info on the VST framework</a>
